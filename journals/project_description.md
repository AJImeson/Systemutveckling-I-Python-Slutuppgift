Project in System Development 


In this project we are tasked to write an effective and automated application that monitors the computers system, gathers information and prints out CPU, RAM and Disk usage.

A User shall be able to interact with the application in a console/terminal and be able to print the info in real time. The application shall not trigger any alerts while being used/run by a user.

Main idea is to have a menu with choices of monitoring of the system, configure alerts and put the application on a Monitoring mode.
