# Systemutveckling-I-Python-Hand-In

- 2025-09-22:

    Lecture about basics of python syntax, loops, booleans etc. Not many new terms compared to doing C# fundamentals. 
    Learnt the basics and understanding of how to REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) in the bash terminal works and why we use it. 
    Sorted most of the exercises from the sheet we were provided, good opportunity to refresh skills within programming.
    Also had a lot of extra error handling research for exercises.

    Did most (basically all) exercises that we were assigned to. Can use a lot of experience/knowledge and ideas from C#.
    Had to do a lot of research in the Python library for certain functions and error handling.

    Constructed a search function in for one of my "cases", uses enumerate to list at positive search. 
    Created a function that calculates average of ages with help of python library and AI Learnt about ternary expression which is a compact if/else one line statement, used it to create a function for clearing the terminal at inputs

    Lecture about more data variables and functions, separate notes and documentation in Google Docs
    Feel a bit overwhelmed by the final hand in of this course, need to sit down and tackle each obstacle one by one

    Learnt how to properly Import Classes and it's functions to a Main from other Folders and files 
    Ran into problems with <modules>. Occured due to root folder issues when trying to import classes and functions. Double check this in the future

    Lecture on functions and refractoring code when "messy" and unstructured 
    Noticed my frustration with error handling and trouble shooting, need to work with being able to "pass" or comment out code and move to next task within a project when "stuck"

    Note: Use a dict in my monitor_running for alerts, different key values depending on alerts needed just as in a list/dict
